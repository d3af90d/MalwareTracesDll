# MalwareTracesDll

Library used to trace network requests made by a particular process by intercepting the API calls related to network requests

# Usage

Load MalwareTracesDLL on the executable whose network requests you wish to analyze. I have a program from that here (TODO: Add link to Injector repo)

# Requirements

The machine need to have a particular folder: `C:\malwareTraces\`

The folder `C:\malwareTraces\` must contain:
	- MalwareTracesDll (The result of compiling this repository)

- Detours library

## Files

In the source code there are four main files:

- dllmain.cpp 
	The DLL main file containing what gets executed when the dll is loaded and unloaded from a process/thread

- TypeDefinitions.h
	Header that contains the definitions for the function pointers to the real API functions

- Utils.h
	Header for utility function and data structures

- Hooks.h
	Header for the custom hook functions
